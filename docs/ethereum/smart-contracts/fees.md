# Fees

[RaribleTransferManager](https://github.com/rarible/protocol-contracts/blob/master/exchange-v2/contracts/RaribleTransferManager.md) supports the following types of fees:

* Protocol fees — are charged on both sides of the transaction.
* Origin fees — set for each order. It may differ for two orders.
* Royalties — the author of the work will receive a part of each sale.

## Algorithm

The transfer of assets takes place inside the `doTransfers`. The following parameters are used as arguments:

* `LibAsset.AssetType` `makeMatch` — `AssetType` on the make-side order
* `LibAsset.AssetType` `takeMatch` — `AssetType` on the take-side order
* `LibFill.FillResult` `fill` — values on both sides that will be passed by match
* `LibOrder.Order` `leftOrder` — left order data
* `LibOrder.Order` `rightOrder` — right order data

In this method, the following actions are performed.

### How do we calculate the commission side of the transaction?

1. Use `LibFeeSide.getFeeSide`. It takes as arguments `assetClasses` of both sides (for example, `ETH` and `ERC20`).
2. `LibFeeSide.getFeeSide` tries to determine side to pay fees:

* If there is ETH on any side of the transaction, it is used.
* If there is no ETH, we check if there is an ERC-20 and use it.
* If there is no ERC-20, check if there is an ERC-1155 and use it.
* Otherwise, no fee will be charged. (e.g. if two ERC-721 are involved in the transaction)

### Transfer

1. If the make-side pays fees:
    * calling `doTransfersWithFees` for the make-side
    * calling `transferPayouts` for the take-side
2. If the take-side pays fees:
    * calling `doTransfersWithFees` for the take-side
    * calling `transferPayouts` for the make-side
3. If the side for the payment of fees are not defined:
    * call `transferPayouts` for both sides

When computing the total amount of the asset:

* The protocol fee is added on top of the filled amount.
* The fee for sending the buyer's order is also added on top.

If the buyer uses the ERC-20 token for payment, he must approve the calculated number of tokens.

If the buyer uses ETH, they must send the calculated amount to ETH along with the transaction.
