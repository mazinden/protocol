# Rarible Protocol Flow

## Overview

Rarible Protocol Flow combines smart contracts for minting, exchanging tokens, APIs for order creation, discovery, standards used in smart contracts.

Main features:

* Minting:
* Exchange (List, Sell/Buy):
    * On-chain mechanics of listing and buying items.
    * Safe removal of an item from the sale if the item has been moved or burned after being put up for sale.
    * Multiple asset types are supported to fill orders: [FT](https://docs.onflow.org/core-contracts/flow-token/) and [NFT](https://docs.onflow.org/core-contracts/fungible-token/).
    * Supported FT:
        * [FLOW](https://docs.onflow.org/core-contracts/flow-token/)
        * [FUSD](https://docs.onflow.org/fusd/transactions/)
        * [FT](https://docs.onflow.org/core-contracts/fungible-token/)
* Indexer:
    * Provides ways to query NFT for contracts that you want to monitor.
    * Exposes ways to create orders.
