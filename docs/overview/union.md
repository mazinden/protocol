# Rarible Protocol

Rarible Protocol is a tool to query, issue and trade NFTs on these blockchains:

* [Ethereum](../ethereum/ethereum-overview.md)
* [Flow](../flow/flow-overview.md)
* [Tezos](../tezos/tezos-overview.md)
* Polygon (WIP, coming soon)

The Rarible Protocol is based on the blockchain layer (smart contracts written for every blockchain supported). These smart contracts allow users to mint and exchange tokens.

On top of the contracts, we built indexers to index part of the blockchain state. This gives us the possibility to query data about NFTs.

Then, SDKs were written to interact with smart contracts.

All these components are written for every blockchain supported and are used in [Multichain service](https://github.com/rarible/union-service) and [Multichain SDK](https://github.com/rarible/sdk).

Applications need to integrate Multichain service and Multichain SDK to be able to interact with all blockchains in the same way.

See [more reasons](../getting-started/reasons.md) to build on Rarible Protocol.

## API Reference

We use different environments for blockchain networks. See actual information on [API Reference](../api-reference.md) page.

## SDK

[Rarible Protocol SDK](https://github.com/rarible/sdk) enables applications to easily interact with Rarible protocol: [query](https://github.com/rarible/sdk#querying), [issue](https://github.com/rarible/sdk#mint), [trade](https://github.com/rarible/sdk#sell) NFTs on any blockchain supported.

See more information on [Multichain SDK](../union-sdk.md) page.
