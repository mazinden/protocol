Meeting document for dev meeting on the 29th of October.

Github discussions: 

https://github.com/rarible/protocol/discussions/142 ```whitespace#2877```

Answer: Eugene to look into it later. Meeting is too short to review there.

https://github.com/rarible/protocol/discussions/11 - related to spam NFT's being minted to someone's collection

Answer: 

We already have discussed about this. There is now a contract where only the owner can mint.

We will have the possibility to deploy private contracts via the SDK, adding the feature is in our backlog. The release can be expected Monday / Tuesday next week (first week of November)

Any collection that has already been released won't be able to benefit from this. 

Github issues: 

Most important: https://github.com/rarible/protocol/issues/148 ```owenmurovec#8687```

Answer: We already fixed this in our contract. There is a PR waiting to be merged, will probably be done by Monday / Tuesday next week (first week of November)

https://github.com/rarible/protocol/issues/147 ```Jaacob#1962``` and ```Branko#7207```

Answer: Need a TXID / Hash 
github issue was updated 

https://github.com/rarible/protocol/issues/143 ```tgb29#1533```

Answer: Metamask should say that there is an exception in the transaction, but that isn't shown correctly. We have raised this issue to the metamask team.

Answer: Need to check at another time / Please DM Eugene on TG

Quote: "could we get an update on latest browser compatible sdk as well that would be much appreciated if there is any way at all to include that in next week's release for tezos etc that would unblock us thanks!"

Answer: We've got a PR open for the browser compatible SDK, we will try to move it to review within the next week. 

```mynamebrody#5466```

Quote: "I think I'm having issues with the encodeOrder endpoint as it wants a signature but that's not required for this call yet so I haven't been including it. But adding the field with an empty value gets past this error, however, I don't think it should be there"

Answer: Will check.

Quote: "@Matt a friend just sent me this, which comes from your documentation.

Is this correct?
We should just fork Rarible Protocol, deploy the protocol to Polygon, then use those contracts to deploy our ERC1155 contracts?"
Just to clarify, i wish to use Rarible's contracts, which i assume to be on, Polygon to deploy our contracts ðŸ™‚ 

Answer: I believe that is correct, to deploy contracts you can fork/clone the repo. What's needed to be done is to put the configuration for Polygon and deploy it to this network. But that's not everything. Rarible Protocol is not only about contracts, is about indexer and sdk as well. We have already deployed our indexer on polygon testnets but with SDK this is a bit harder because we would like to use meta transactions which means we would need to change our SDK to support these meta transactions. These are these main tasks we need to get done in order to use Polygon. We'll try it after we deploy on Tezos and Flow. Might try initial testing next week. Would be better to wait imo.

Quote: "Hi All, I'm looking for a Rarible API that would return the assetType for any NFT listed on the marketplace. In other words, I'm looking for something like: 
GET <API URL>?itemId=<contract address>:<token ID>

and I expect to get an answer that would contain a field with ERC721 or ERC1155 or Lazy_mint, something of that sort, so that I can use that value to create a new buy order. I haven't found anything of that sort. For some NFTs there are open orders which hold the assetType, but I'm looking for a standard way that would work on every NFT on Rarible, not just NFTs with open or past orders.

Any help would be appreciated."

Answer: If SDK is used, that's not needed. They just need to get an order and execute field in the SDK and the inverted order will be automatically made. If any further help is needed contact

```owenmurovec#8687```

Quote: "Trying to use the encodeOrder endpoint but getting an error response (Using the exact example request from the docs https://docs.rarible.org/exchange/creating-a-sell-order):
{
"code": "BAD_REQUEST",
    "message": "Instantiation of [simple type, class com.rarible.protocol.dto.RaribleV2OrderFormDto] value failed for JSON property signature due to missing (therefore NULL) value for creator parameter signature which is a non-nullable type\n at [Source: (io.netty.buffer.ByteBufInputStream); line: 24, column: 1] (through reference chain: com.rarible.protocol.dto.RaribleV2OrderFormDto[\"signature\"])",
    "status": 400
}

According to the API reference (https://api-reference.rarible.com/#operation/encodeOrder), the signature field should be optional but seems like that's what's causing the error? Tried adding the signature field as an empty string "" or as "0x" and it seems to work however it gives an EIP712 type signMessage when I need an EIP1271 type.

Anyone know what could be going wrong? or if there's a specific value I can set signature to for an EIP1271 type instead?"

Answer: creating-a-sell-order in the docs is a bit outdated, we'll fix that. Also. encodeOrder is deprecated, it's better to use SDK. Rarible docs now have a blockchain agnostic structure that isn't tied to Ethereum, there is information on how to use the SDK there.

Quote: "Hi, I am trying to lazy mint NFT using this asset creation article https://docs.rarible.org/asset/creating-an-asset 

But I am getting below 400 with invalid token, its missing creator address. I checked a lot of times and not sure what needs to be done

 data: {
    }
      code: 'VALIDATION',

      status: 400


Did anyone face this? Can anyone help me out in this or if there is a way to see more logs?"

Answer: Same as the answer above, please use SDK. 


```fruitybits#4442```

Quote: "another royalties question ðŸ™‚ I'm implementing some ERC721 contracts on Polygon. I want them to be ready to use Rarible Royalties when Rarible supports Polygon/Matic. Is there anything I can implement now (e.g. Royalties V1 from the docs) or do I need to sit tight?"

Answer: Royalties V1 or V2 will do. Any version will be working on Polygon without a problem once we deploy there.
