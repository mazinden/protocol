# Community and resources

## DAO

If you're a builder or you're looking to participate in the Rarible Protocol DAO, here are a few valuable places you'll find support and like-minded builders.

* [Discord](https://discord.gg/zqsZsEWBbN) is one of the main places where the DAO is being organized, and builders take their first steps towards building with the protocol.
* [Github](https://github.com/rarible) is where everything lives. Since we are open-source, many resources and help from other builders are available there.
* [Notion](https://rarible-protocol.notion.site/rarible-protocol/Rarible-Protocol-DAO-f89d6db21a9d4c199eb30051fceb9a0a) is the platform where we hold information for DAO members and $RARI token holders.
* [OpenAPI](https://api.rarible.org/v0.1/doc) is where we document the current API capabilities.
* [DAO Twitter](https://twitter.com/raribledao)
