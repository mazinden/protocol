# Transfer, Mint, Burn

Transfer, minting, and burning are the primary operations we can invoke on the blockchain. Below you can find a "how to use it" description.

## ERC721-NFT Lazy Minting

To lazy mint an item following parameters are required:

* URI â€” address of data on IPFS
* supply â€” number of NFTs to create (not in every case it is supported, you can check it by reading sdk.nft.mint response under multiple parameters)
* lazyMint â€” boolean, if we want to mint it lazily or normally
* creators â€” the array of creators, which allows distributing profits from sell in accordance to defined criteria
* royalties â€” the array of royalties, which allows taking a defined amount of any consecutive sell

!!! note ""

    Whenever you see the need for Multichain / Contract address, you can create it as follows:

    1. Blockchain Name
    2. Hex Address

    Example:

    `BlockchainName:HexAddress` = `ETHEREUM:0xB0EA149212Eb707a1E5FC1D2d3fD318a8d94cf05`

```typescript
// Examplary values of URI and supply
const [uri, setUri] = useState<string>(
  "ipfs:/QmWLsBu6nS4ovaHbGAXprD1qEssJu4r5taQfB74sCG51tp"
);
const [supply, setSupply] = useState<number>(1);

const currentWallet = wallet as EthereumWallet;
const makerAccount = await currentWallet.ethereum.getFrom();

// 1. Create PrepareMintRequest
// Collection ids are the address of Rarible Smart Contracts instance
// You can find them here:
// https://docs.rarible.org/ethereum/contract-addresses/

const mintRequest: PrepareMintRequest = {
  // Using Rarible API, tokenId would also be needed, but SDK takes care for that
  collectionId: toContractAddress(
    "ETHEREUM:0x6ede7f3c26975aad32a475e1021d8f6f39c89d82"
  ),
};

// 2. Get Mint Response
// From mintResponse you can extract additional info e.g. is supply > 1 enabled
const mintResponse = await sdk.nft.mint(mintRequest);

// If you want to divide profits here, you can add more than one creator object
// Combined value amount has to be 10000, which equals to 100 %, same with royalties
const creators = [
  {
    account: `ETHEREUM:${makerAccount}`,
    value: 10000,
  },
];

const royalties = [];

// 3. Submit Mint Response
const submitResponse = await mintResponse.submit({
  uri,
  supply,
  lazyMint: true, // Lazy Mint is not always available, you can check it in mint response created in step 2
  creators,
  royalties,
});

// Example of successful response
// itemId: "ETHEREUM:0x6ede7f3c26975aad32a475e1021d8f6f39c89d82:55143609719300586327244080327388661151936544170854464635146779205246455382047"
// type: "off-chain"
```

## ERC721-NFT Lazy Mint & Sell

Often you want to list your nft on the sale right after creation. If it's the case for you, you can also use the `mintAndSell` function, which allows you to do exactly that.

```typescript
// We can get user account in that way, or just extract it from accounts
// which we saved with Metamask
const currentWallet = wallet as EthereumWallet;
const makerAccount = await currentWallet.ethereum.getFrom();

// Price in ETH
const price: number = 1;

const mintRequest: PrepareMintRequest = {
  collectionId: toContractAddress(
    "ETHEREUM:0x6ede7f3c26975aad32a475e1021d8f6f39c89d82"
  ),
};

const ethCurrency: EthErc20AssetType = {
  "@type": "ERC20",
  contract: toContractAddress(
    "ETHEREUM:0xc778417e063141139fce010982780140aa0cd5ab"
  ),
};

const mintResponse = await sdk.nft.mintAndSell(mintRequest);

const response = await mintResponse.submit({
  uri,
  supply: 1,
  lazyMint: true,
  price,
  creators: [
    {
      account: toMultichianAddress(`ETHEREUM:${makerAccount}`),
      value: 10000,
    },
  ],
  currency: ethCurrency,
});

// Response:
// ItemId
// OrderId
```

## Transfer NFT Token

If we want to transfer NFT Token from one wallet address to another, it is simple.
Of course, if you want to submit a transfer transaction, you have to be the owner of an NFT.

You will need:

* `itemId`
* `transferRequest: PrepareTransferRequest`

```typescript
const itemId =
  "ETHEREUM:0x6ede7f3c26975aad32a475e1021d8f6f39c89d82:55143609719300586327244080327388661151936544170854464635146779205246455382052";

const transferRequest: PrepareTransferRequest = {
  itemId: toItemId(itemId),
};

const transferResponse = await sdk.nft.transfer(transferRequest);

const response = await transferResponse.submit({
  to: toMultichianAddress("ETHEREUM:0x79Ea2d536b5b7144A3EabdC6A7E43130199291c0"),
});
```

## Burning tokens ðŸ”¥

Burning tokens is equivalent to sending them to address 0x0 because nobody has a private key for that.

Using SDK, you can do that as follows:

```typescript
const itemId =
  "ETHEREUM:0x6ede7f3c26975aad32a475e1021d8f6f39c89d82:55143609719300586327244080327388661151936544170854464635146779205246455382052";

const burnRequest: PrepareBurnRequest = {
  itemId: toItemId(itemId),
};

const burnResponse = await sdk.nft.burn(burnRequest);

const response = await burnResponse.submit();
```

## Generate Token ID Request

This is not a mandatory step because while using the mint or `mintAndSell` function, it's automatically done underneath, but it can be useful while using API.

Because of lazy minting specification, Rarible generates token id to store it off-chain until the token is actually minted.

```typescript
const genTokenIdReq: GenerateTokenIdRequest = {
  collection: toMultichianAddress(
    "ETHEREUM:0x6ede7f3c26975aad32a475e1021d8f6f39c89d82"
  ),
  minter: toMultichianAddress("ETHEREUM:0x79Ea2d536b5b7144A3EabdC6A7E43130199291c0"),
};

const tokenIdResponse = await sdk.nft.generateTokenId(genTokenIdReq);
```

## Preprocessing Metadata

We use preprocessing to prepare metadata for different blockchains (eth, flow, tezos, etc.).

```typescript
const blockchain = Blockchain.ETHEREUM;
const metadata: CommonTokenMetadata = {
  name: "Hey",
  description: undefined,
  image: undefined,
  animationUrl: undefined,
  externalUrl: undefined,
  attributes: [],
};

const request: PreprocessMetaRequest = {
  blockchain,
  ...metadata,
};

const response = sdk.nft.preprocessMeta(request);
```
